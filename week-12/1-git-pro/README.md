## Workshop for Teams
### Do this as a Team in a group
- only once, not every team member separately
- choose base language
    - python
    - javascript
    - java
- create a repo and a project
- create a gitignore file with appropriate content for the chosen language (JAVA team should search for IntelliJ IDEA gitignore ;) )
- assign your team members to
    - Member A
    - Member B
    - Member C
- and after that follow your section separately

### Member A tasks
- clone the empty project repo
- create a method called `greet` in a file/class of your choice that prints out your name
- commit as 'a1' and push
- wait for abc1 commits then pull
- you should have 3 files with 3 methods
- modify your method to have one parameter and print that out
- commit as 'a2' and push
- modify `count` method to print out the number of the month you're born in
- wait for abc2 commits on remote
- commit as 'a3' and push
- examine the conflicts
    - check what is yours, whats not
    - what is HEAD
- resolve conflicts (remove the <<< and >>> lines, and merge the code)
- commit as 'a4' and push
- wait for abc4 commits then pull
- create a branch called `yourname-twoparam`
    - good branch names always indicates the creators name and the thing they plan to work on
    - hint: `git checkout -b branchname`
- modify your method to have two parameters and print out both
- commit as 'a5' and push
    - hint: you'll need to specify the remote and the remote branch, since this is the first commit of this branch
    - now you should have the branch on github as well, check that!
- do a simple merge locally
    - checkout the master branch (this will be the branch you're merging _to_)
    - `git merge branchname_youremerging_from`
    - see? if there are no conflicts merge is done easily :)
- now push the master branch
- wait for abc5 commits in remote master
- checkout your feature branch again
- modify the `cheer` method to print out 'Cheer for the `parameter`'
- commit as 'a6' and push to your branch
- go on github and create a pull request
    - base fork should be the master branch
    - head fork should be your branch
    - this will create a request on github for your changes to be merged automatically to the master branch
    - You can set a title and a description to describe the changes
    - Select Member B for assignee (who will review and accept your request)
- wait for Member C's pull request, check it
    - there should be a the title, the description, the commits, and you can see the changes made
    - there should be a big Accept this Pull Request button, currently in disabled state
    - tell Member C that she/he needs to resolve conflicts on that branch for this PR to be acceptable
- probably you got the same instruction so resolve the conflict on your PR
    - if you're not on that branch, checkout
    - merge in the master branch
    - hint: remember be on the branch you want to merge _to_
    - now you want to merge to your branch
- wait for Member C's PR's update on Github
    - if its acceptable, accept it
