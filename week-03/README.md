## Project
Palindome Kata
The Kata has two part, the first one is mandatory for everybody, the second
is just for students, who already know programming.

### 1st Part:
Create a function that takes a string and creates a palindrome from it.
It should work like this:
```python
output = create_palindrome('pear')

print(output) # it prints: pearraep
```
### 2nd Part:
Create a function that searches for all the palindromes in a string that are
at least than 3 characters, and returns a list with the found palindromes.
Example:
```python
output = search_palindromes('dog goat dad duck doodle never')
print(output) # it prints: ['og go', ' dad ', 'd d', 'dood', 'eve']
```


## Demo description
Creating simple algorithms as searching palindromes in a string, to practice variables, conditionals, loops and the other basic elements of a programming languages in python
