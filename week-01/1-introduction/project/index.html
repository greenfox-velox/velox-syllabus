      <h1>💩How She Got There</h1>
      <h2>An interview with Mule Design’s Erika Hall about philosophy, phone calls and her professional journey.</h2>
      <p>
        <em>
          In the fall of 2013 I interviewed Erika Hall, co-founder of <a href="http://muledesign.com">Mule Design Studio</a>, one of the most influential design practices in North America. It was the first of fourteen interviews that I would conduct for my book How They Got There: Interviews With Digital Designers About Their Careers, and so in many ways it was the most important, too.

        <strong>
          You studied philosophy at Dartmouth. How did you get from there into doing the kind of work that you’re doing? What was the first step?
        </strong>

      <p>
        Well, let’s see, the first step was graduating into a recession with a philosophy degree [laughs].
